# Elizabeth-Assignment-2
Higher/Lower Guessing Game
NOTES taken to create game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guess a number randomly chosen between 1 and 100

random number generated at the start of the game

prompt player to pick a number 1 to 100 inclusive INT only no doubles or floats

numbers outside this range will display "Your guess is not between 1 and 100 please try again
do not remove a guess from the player if entered invalid input

when entering a valid guess:
prompt one of three messages:

1. please pick a higher number (if # chosen is lower) or

2. please pick a lower number (if # chosen is higher) or

3. you win! (if they guess the correct number

Player only gets 5 chances to guess the number. invalid answer does not affect number of guesses

after 5 tries, game is over and outputted message should read "You lose, the number to guess was
theRandomNumber" 

once the user fails to guess the number, or they correctly guess the number, the game is over and the
application ends

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variables:

int theRandomNumber; //Random number generated by computer
int theUserGuess;   //Number guessed by the user
int i;		     //For loop
int tries = 5;	     // Number of guesses allowed

1.Randomize computer number FIRST -- Random random = new Random() -- theRandomNumber = random.nextInt(100)
				  -- theRandomNumber += 1 //To get a result from the required range

2. Pick a number -- System print "Pick a number between..." -- theUserGuess = input.nextInt();

3. Error message if outside range -- while loop? while ( theUserNumber < 1 || theUserNumber > 100) 
				  -- Prompt pick a number message again, please try again

4. 5 guesses, so...for loop? five iterations + if statements? use a break; to jump out of a loop

	for ( i = 1; i <= tries; i++ ) {

		if ( theUserGuess == theRandomNumber) {
			System.out.print("You win!");
			break;
		}

		else if ( theUserGuess > theRandomNumber && i != tries) {
			System.out.println("Please pick a lower number:");
			theUserGuess = input.nextInt();
		}

		else ( theUserGuess < theRandomNumber && i != tries) {

			System.out.println("Please pick a higher number:");
			theUserGuess = input.nextInt();
		}
	}

	if ( i == tries) {

		System.out.println("You lose, the number to guess was " + theRandomNumber);
